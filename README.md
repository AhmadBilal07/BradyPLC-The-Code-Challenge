# BradyPLC-The-Code-Challenge
The Code Challenge is a part of the Brady recruitment process.

## Description of the Task
A production ready solution (Console Application) written in C#

An XML file contains generator data (see accompanying file GenerationReport.xml) is produced and provided as input into an input folder on a regular basis. 
The solution automatically pick up the received XML file as soon as it is placed in the input folder (location of input folder is set in the Application app.config file), perform parsing and data processing as appropriate to achieve the following:
1.	Calculate and output the Total Generation Value for each generator.
2.	Calculate and output the generator with the highest Daily Emissions for each day along with the emission value.
3.	Calculate and output Actual Heat Rate for each coal generator. 

The output should be a single XML file in the format as specified by an example accompanying file GenerationOutput.xml into an output folder (location of output folder is set in the Application app.config file).  

â€ƒ
### Calculation Definitions and Reference Data
Daily Generation Value = Energy x Price x ValueFactor <br />
Daily Emissions = Energy x EmissionRating x EmissionFactor <br />
Actual Heat Rate = TotalHeatInput / ActualNetGeneration <br />

### Note
Emissions only apply to fossil fuel generator types e.g. coal and gas. There could be a varying number of generators of a given type in any one GenerationReport.xml file that is produced.

ValueFactor and EmissionsFactor is static data sourced from the accompanying XML file ReferenceData.xml. 

Generator Types map to factors as follows:
| Generator Type    | ValueFactor       | EmissionFactor   |
| ------------------|:-----------------:| ----------------:|
|Offshore Wind      |Low	              |N/A
|Onshore Wind       |High               | N/A	
|Gas	              |Medium	            |Medium             
|Coal	              |Medium	            |High
